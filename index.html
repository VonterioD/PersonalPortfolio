                    <p>
                        Hello, my name is Vonterio Duncan and I am a young Software Developer ready to take the next step in my career. I graduated from the institution of University of South Florida with a <b>Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science</b> back in December 2020. I started out my developing journey with the language <b>Java</b> in high school because of my interest in video games. In my senior year of high school I had my first Java course, and then in my first semster of college I had another that furthered my understanding.
                    </p> 
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the rest of my college career I mainly used <b>C++</b> in courses such as <b>Data Structures, Algorithms, Object Oriented Software Design</b>, etc. I have also been exposed to some <b>C, PHP, and Python</b>. For about a year now, I have decided that I want to learn full-stack web development. As of late, I have mainly focused on the front-end, having taken courses on Udemy, watched YouTube videos, and made some projects to enhance my <b>HTML, CSS, and JS</b> skills. I am currently trying to learn more about the React library/framework. I  do plan to get into the back-end soon, I have Udemy courses on MongoDB and Express/Node JS that will be used for guidance. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I am looking for a role in the Software Development field that I can learn and grow as a developer. I never want my skills to stagnate, and I believe my <b>enthusiasm, hard-work, and team-player</b> characteristics would be valuable to any company. Hope the rest of my portfolio will show what I am capable of. Thank you!
                    </p>

                            This is my very first personal project (outside of a classroom) that I created near the end of my freshman year in college. I first started to code because I always liked video games, and the first language I picked up was Java during my high school years. I had my first official coding class in my senior year of high school, and one of my classes in my first semester was Java as well. So, I finally felt like it was time to build something on my own from scratch. I took a simple tutorial on how to move a ball on a screen, and then turned it into my own small game.

                            This was probably the toughest project that I was assigned in college. This was in my junior year Algorithms class, and this group project was to focus on the whole idea of memoization in recursion problems. This is a technique used to speed up programs by storing results of expensive function calls. The purpose of this project was to use C++ and take in information from a text file, with the first two numbers on line one being the row and columns and the rest being the actual matrix, and to get the maximum score and the path obtained to get that.

                            I have been going off and on for about a year (junior - senior year in college) with getting into Web Development. I knew about basic HTML and CSS concepts, but did not dive in deeper than that. Once I got into the groove with my classes in my senior year,  I noticed I had more free time than ever due to everything being online and activities being cancelled due to COVID-19. This is when I started to dive deeper into web development concepts, learning from Udemy courses that I have bought in the past, and watching YouTube tutorials. After finishing the majority of HTML, CSS, and Javascript on Udemy, I finally decided to build my first personal responsive site.

                            I took an independent study project class in the summer before my senior year in college. This is an oppurtunity for a student to dive in and learn about or create something in a field that they have not been exposed to in standard courses. I was always a part of the Ultimate Frisbee club during college and there was an app that teams would use to track statistics - Ultianalytics. I always wanted to create a mobile app, and loved the sport of ultimate, so this was the perfect time to dive in and try to recreate that app and get experience at the same time.

                            This is my second personal website, made about a week after my first one. This is a website centered around the marriage between my fiance' and I. So yes, this is us and all pictures belong to me, but shot by our photgrapher. We already had a website made using Wedding Wire's tools (Link to that one here). However, I decided to recreate it and get some more practice on my own. This site, like my last, uses pure HTML, CSS, and JS. The only external libraries used are Font-Awesome for some icons, and Lightbox for the image gallery.
